<h1>Hello, world!👋🏼</h1>

My name is Dante33 and I am planning to begin my journey as self taught programmer, here with GitHub community. I am from Ukraine 🇺🇦 , but due to the ongoing act of aggression and terrorism from our neighbours, I had to leave my country and relocate to Germany 🇩🇪 . Following the news and different analytics about the future outcome of the events in my home country, I've realised that the conflict is not ending any time soon.. so I just have to start organising my life in Germany and thinking of the ways to make profit. I had a full time job in the logistics sphere back in Kyiv, but after my forced relocation, I couldn't continue so I've began my attempts of finding a job in logistics here in Germany, which ended up in a failure due to the lack of German language..

It was at that moment when the idea of remote work came to my mind, a source of income which is not affected by my location and can be successfully done in English. I did some research and wasn't surprised that the tech industry had an impressive amount of remote positions available on the labour market and very competitive salaries. After following some amazing programming content creators out there, like **@tiffintech, @marwane.dev, @javascript_wizz, @girlcodemx and an amazing @acodingnomad** who is herself is a self taught programmer and thanks to Khris for developing an idea inside of me to follow, commit and joining the passion of programming and coding. Thank you all for your content, motivation and guidance!

<h2>My learning strategy</h2>

👨🏼‍💻 Once I begin my journey, I will be uploading everything new that I learn in a day with my personal feedback and thoughts. At the very moment, my focus is made on the following:

1. **Basics of programming (what is code, how it changed our lives and what it's capable of?)**
- Will first of all complete Harvard’s free CS50 course in Computer Science and most likely their Introduction to programming with Python course as well

2. **Programming Languages - to find the one that suits me the most and develop in that direction.**
- Most likely it's going to be JavaScript (maybe React), Python or even something like C# / GOlang. But surely at the end, I will just stick with one of them.

3. **To analyse all the branches and spheres of programming world and build an understanding of what I am really aiming to achieve.**
- At the moment I am interested in Front End Development, Software Engineering and Cloud Architecture.

4. **Visual Studio as my code editor, get to know it and setup all the necessary plugins.**
- From what I know at the very moment, pretty much most of the programmers use and recommend Visual Studio Code Editor

I am open to any feedback and comments, if you think there are things that I've could've done or do better, please don't hesitate to let me know! After all that is why I joined GitHub and hope it makes as promising impact on my journey, as I expect. 🧩🗂💬

*This blog is for personal use only, the main idea is to record my step by step learning process, to better understand the basic fundamentals, get the required assistance and guidance for colleagues on GitHub and buildup some material for the future employers and personal portfolio.*
