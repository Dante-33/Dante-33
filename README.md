Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!👋🏼");

My name is Dante33 and I am planning to beggin my journey as a Game Designer & Game Developer, here with GitHub community.

👨🏼‍💻 Once I begin my journey, I will be uploading everything new that I learn in a day with my personal feedback and thoughts. At the very moment, my focus is made on the following:

1) Basics of programming (what is code, how it changed our lives and what it's capable of?)
2) Programming Languages - C#, Golang (GO) and C++.
3) History and concept of Game Development, different game genres and game progress throughout the years.
4) Visual Studio as my code editor.
5) Unity or Unreal Engine (still deciding which game engine is more valuable for me and 2023). 💭

My ultimate GOAL💫 is to become a part of one of the largest and in my opinion most successful game companies - RIOT Games. I truly believe that the company itself and the current games it has, like "League of Legends", "Valorant", "Wild Rift" (mobile version of League of Legends) and some upcoming projects like "Song of Nunu" and "Project L" have an immensive room for growth, as well as a bright and prospecting future.

I am open to any feedback and comments, if you think there are things that I've could of done or do better, please don't hasitate to let me know! After all that is why I joined GitHub and hope it makes as promising impact on my journey, as I expect. 🧩🗂💬
