<h1>Hello, world!👋🏼</h1>

My name is Dante33 and I am planning to begin my journey as self taught programmer, here with GitHub community. I am from Ukraine 🇺🇦 , but due to the ongoing act of aggression and terrorism from our neighbours, I had to leave my country and relocate to Germany 🇩🇪 . Following the news and different analytics about the future outcome of the events in my home country, I've realised that the conflict is not ending any time soon.. so I just have to start organising my life in Germany and thinking of the ways to make profit. I had a full time job in the logistics sphere back in Kyiv, but after my forced relocation, I couldn't continue so I've began my attempts of finding a job in logistics here in Germany, which ended up in a failure due to the lack of German language..

It was at that moment when the idea of remote work came to my mind, a source of income which is not affected by my location and can be successfully done in English. I did some research and wasn't surprised that the tech industry had an impressive amount of remote positions available on the labour market and very competitive salaries. After following some amazing programming content creators out there, like **@tiffintech, @marwane.dev, @javascript_wizz, @girlcodemx and an amazing @acodingnomad** who is herself is a self taught programmer and thanks to Khris for developing an idea inside of me to follow, commit and joining the passion of programming and coding. Thank you all for your content, motivation and guidance!
